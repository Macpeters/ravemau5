# Ravemau5

## Code
* Initially built in Game Maker Studio, it has now been ported to GMS2.  There were some losses along the way, including paralax background scrolling.  

## Current Build
* [Source Code](https://github.com/Macpeters/ravemau5_html)
* [Playable HTML Game](https://trusting-albattani-040749.netlify.com/)


## The Game

### Player Controls
* arrow keys + space
* soft joystick for mobile (people have found this less than intuitive, it may need revisiting)

### Baddies/Dangers
* beetles - jump on top to kill, otherwise they hurt the player.  They aren't visible enough in the dark
* slime blobs - can't be killed currently.  I'd like to add a range weapon to deal with them
* stationary shooter - needs to be redesigned
* once baddies are killed, they don't respawn.  That could be addressed once slime blobs are killable
* should shooters be destructable?

### Interactive Enviromental Elements
* ice
* moving platforms
* fire/toxic lava stuff

### Audio
* I added a song for each world, and some effects, but honestly, they're terrible, so I've turned them off for now.

### Extras
* there is a save file, but it's not very useful right now, since worlds/characters are all unlocked by default, and collectable glow rings aren't good for anything.  Might be useful later (famous last words)
