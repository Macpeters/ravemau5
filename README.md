This is a platformer game I'm making in GM Studio - with plans to build for web, ios and android.  There aren't enough good platformers, I think, and I want a game that's fun and fanciful and packed full of surprises like the days of yore.  Not really meant to be a collaboration, but hey, it's public, so what the hell.  If you want to get in on the fun, by all means.  This is my first major project with GM, so I expect a lot of iteration.
